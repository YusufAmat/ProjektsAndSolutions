TASK!!!👑 👑 👑  Create a class called Pizza that contains information about a single pizza.

The Pizza class must contain ;

Private variables to store:
1- The size of the pizza (small, medium or large),
2- Number of cheeses,
3- Number of salami/sausages,
4-Number of spices,

Constructors that set all instance variables.
Generic methods for getting and setting instance variables.
A generic method called calcCost() to calculate the cost of pizza.

The cost of pizza is determined as follows:

Small: $10 + $2 per Variety
Medium: $12 + $2 per Variety
Large: $14 + $2 per Variety

A generic method called getDescription() returns a String containing the size of the pizza,
the quantity of each ingredient, and the cost of the pizza calculated by calcCost().

Write test code to create several pizzas and extract their descriptions.
👉 For example, a large pizza with one cheese, one sausage and two spices should cost a total of $22.
