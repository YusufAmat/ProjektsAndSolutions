TASK !!!  Define a class called BlogEntry that could be used to store an entry for a Web blog.
You should get below information with Scanner from user.
The class should have PRIVATE instance variables to store :
1-the posterâ€™s username,
2-text of the entry,
3-date of the entry
Add a constructor that allows the user of the class to set all instance variables.
Also add a method, displayEntry() , that outputs usernames and dates,
and another method called getSummary() that returns the first 10 characters from the text
(or the entire text if it is less than 10 characters).
Test your class from your main method.
